# Assignment

- Connect to the SWAPI The Star Wars API - please see: https://swapi.dev/ and display the data.
  Requirements
- Display the data in an organized, logical, and readable way, nice user interface, easy usability.
- At least 3 types of data, for ex. (People, Films and Species).
- Demonstrate navigation capabilities from one view to another related/hierarchical view. (example: from list of films to a single film -> from single film to single character -> from that single character to any related films)

## Bonus

- Associate the Star Wars Objects with any royalty free images API. Your objects can have any image chosen by yourself.
  Test objectives
- In general, we want to have at least some code in the following languages:
  -- TypeScript
  -- CSS or SCSS
- Using any external library/framework is allowed.

# Keep in mind

- Write readable code, with meaningful functions and variables names.
- Extract your code to classes where a class or a function only have one specific purpose.
- Only write comments, if code is not self-explanatory (which it should be for the most part).
- Try to write your own code. Importing libraries must be for a good reason.
